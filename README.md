# Coding workbench

This is a monorepo where I collect, create, publish, and maintain code I want to re-use across projects, such as React components and JS utils.

## Getting Started

- Be sure to have [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) installed and that you are running Node [version 20.x](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases).
- In the repo root, run `pnpm i`.

## Develop

- To update are add new components or utils, run `pnpm dev`. This will watch individual package source code for changes, and also start a Storybook playground app.
